# What is automatic UI testing? #

The best answer for this question i know is:

automatic UI testing is to do the following things automatically

http://swtfinder.googlecode.com/files/UITesting.GIF

  * Finder special UI component automatically
  * Drive actions on the found component automatically
  * And validate components after the UI action automatically.


of course, other functions also need to be provided for a good automatic ui testing.

  * exception handle.
  * logging
  * centralized test data
  * ...

and facilitate in:
  * And validate components after the UI action automatically.
since before validate some ui component , your must find it first!
